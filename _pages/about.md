Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Prof. [Qi Long](https://www.med.upenn.edu/long-lab/) and Prof. [Weijie J. Su](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~suw/). 

Privously, I obtained my Ph.D. from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, where I was advised by Prof. [Zhi-Quan (Tom) Luo](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/214) and worked closely with Prof. [Ruoyu Sun](https://ruoyus.github.io). Prior to that, I received my M.S. degree from The Chinese University of Hong Kong and my B.S. degree from Sun Yat-sen University.

1. **Learning theory**: optimization (non-convex, non-smooth problem, convergence and stability), generalization (Rademacher complexity, VC-dim, Pac-Bayes, NTK)
2. **Adversarial Robustness**: theory, robust overfitting, adversarially robust generalization
3. **Large Language Models**:  theory, fine-tuning, algorithmic bias, calibration
